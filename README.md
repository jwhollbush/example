# Outline of Flow2Pro Skateboard Sponsorship Decentralized Microeconomy Dapp 
Utilizing existing social media platforms specifically open source and blockchain-centric format to  develop micro economy with skaters who play the role of brand ambassadors to retail shops and brands, with contributions but artists, musicians, graphic artists, and animators, as well as ai software developers focused on Blockchain Ecosystem. 

The cooperative entity model would be used to capture and retain wealth to a community.
Existing Blockchain Assets Held By Deranged Brain; Including XLM Sidechain Token and ERC20 can be use, and or other Open payment network's ability to issue build up such an ecosystem with capabilities that can create and issue an asset on the networks,  that would hold value/utility within the participants our project.

Skateboard brand business development deals to onboard key players, management at each level, and run the numbers for what kind of benefits would most incentivize participation and financial sustainability.

# Biz dev & deals with numbers mutually lucritive for all:Which would benefit by exposure to the culture:
•Sponsored Athletes
• Retail shops
• Rrands seeking to reach
•Graphic artists
•Merchandise vendors:

# Assemble Code S/w Dev team to achieve a working Testnet Iteration to Pursue Various Grantand Funding Campaign Applications 

U/X & U/I DesignAn dapp that allows for basic video production/geo tagging functionality allows users ambassador skaters, and delegates to upload and share media within the app environment and supports basic messaging and timeline features to user interaction.

# Initial Whitepaper Offering

Ambassador skaters would be pre vetted to bring adoption by region or by other skate culture criteria to the app. Those pre-ambassadors would have pre-existing agreements in place that their uploaded footage is available as royalty free content to ecosystem brands in exchange for sponsorship in the form of brand merchandise and the option to produce custom co-branded merchandise.

The ambassador Athlete would earn “street cred" , EUROPA network trusted token/asset that they can choose to share with other user as kudos for tricks and content. 

The street cred token/asset would be redeemable for admission to competitions/events and participating retail shops. When the athlete reached a predetermined threshold of tokens, and influence the athlete would be eligible for one of three levels of sponsorship by shops, and other affiliated entities who would benefit from co branded content.

The value proposition for each participant of this ecosystem would need to be refined and would look something like this:

Retail shops: benefit from the exclusivity to sell co-branded merch with emerging pro talent as well as address the real world challenge or getting physical patronage at brick and mortar skate shop locations, as the initial phase would rather aquireing retail support of the market by rewarding skates and, participating fans by airdrop of EUROPA, token. et al. 

Brands: would benefit from influencer marketing and reach of user produce content 

Skaters: would benefit from a % both the redeemed value of tokens and normal sales for their co-branded merchandise. 

Athletes, Artists, Distributors would opt in for a proof of Stake Mining, and or DAO. Shops would adopt Stellar Payment Rails to Seemlessly be able to accept fiat while all contract signing consenses delivers each recipient their asset instantly. All contracts, would need to be programmed and put in place as each onboard occurred.

General app users: would benefit from the access to interact and earn real world value/kudos (street cred token) from peers they follow/admire.

All would benefit from the Decentralized nature of a blockchain tokenized ecosystem that is all inclusive, where payments settle instantly through smart contract technology. End fiat dependence conversion at point of sales.

# Stellar clarifications

Unlike virtual machine blockchain networks; Stellar doesn’t require network computing for app. Stellar simply handles operations and transactions between participating nodes on the network.

# Addition IBC Chain Intergrations Required for Resources to Run Dapp Contracts 

This allows devs to build features for an app to scale dynamically on devices like AWS or other cloud infrastructure, especially considering adoption of EOS, ATOM and other interchain virtual machine technology, with dpos, and trust technology where when skaters desire sponsorship, would require required tokens to stake into the branded content, ai generated video production.
